# pytorch-helper

---

#### Less boilerplate. The goal with this library was to provide an easy and flexible approach to designing neural nets

#### Quickly build custom and non standard networks 

#### Built on top of pytorch and abstracts pytorch hooks to debug and monitor gradient flows, weights and activations

#### Track and plot loss and accuracy curves with training api 

#### Create model checkpoints and auto save model based on loss and accuracy thresholds

#### Extensible and customizable - easily add your module or debug and monitor function at forward or backward pass

#### Fully fleshed out ready to use modules to build and train FFNs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, AEs, VAEs and transformer networks
